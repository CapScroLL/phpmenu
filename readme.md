## Install

Make a clone of this repository on your disk and just download every files and store them in a folder like f.i. `c:\scripts\phpmenu`.

### Environnement variable - PATH

To use the scripts present in this repository, once copied onto your hard disk (let's say `c:\scripts\phpmenu`), make sure that you've initialized the `%PATH%` environnement variable of Windows and add `c:\scripts\phpmenu` as one of the first entry; should be before your global `Composer\vendor\bin` entry).

This will make life easier: by opening a DOS prompt in any folder (like `c:\my_repositories\php_amazing`), you can just type `phpmenu` and Windows will run the one of `c:\scripts\phpmenu`.

### Composer - Global

This done, you'll also need to configure your local global composer directory by either installing dependencies one by one or by copying the `composer.json` file that you'll find in this current repository to your `%APPDATA%\Composer` folder. Note: you can also create a `symlink` in `%APPDATA%\Composer` and refer to the current `composer.json` file.

Once copied there, run `composer global update` to get the latest version and/or install dependencies.

### File .phpmenu-ignore

Scripts will scan / solve issues in your project tree structure but there are folders that can (should) be ignored like `.git`, `vendor`, ...

You can mention such folder once in the `.phpmenu-ignore` file for all scripts. Just edit the `.phpmenu-ignore` and add one line by folder that should be ignored.

Also do this in the `phpstan.neon` file that is used by `PHPSTAN`. Take a look on the `excludes_analyse` entry in `phpstan.neon`.

## Usage

Open a DOS prompt, go to your PHP project root folder (like `c:\my_repositories\php_amazing`) and run `phpmenu` (refer to the [Install](#install) chapter here above if not working)

### PHPMENU

This script will display an interface and allow you to choose which script should be started:

```
======================================
= PHPMENU                            =
= Which scripts do you want to start =
======================================

Tip: need to scan only one folder? Call phpmenu with the foldername like this: "phpmenu Myclasses"

#### 1. PHAN

Phan is a static analyzer for PHP and will help to have a better codebase and a more robust code.

Phan offers 5 levels of controls, from `Emergency` (only report really severe problems) to `LOW` (max report level) for purists like me who want zero warning.

Phan will scan the code and check f.i. against unused variables,

Phan goes so far as to check the doc-block blocks to see if you have indicated the right variables, types, etc. and we all know that we quickly change the name / type of a parameter and forget to keep the doc-block up to date; Phan will see it.

You can use rules defined in this package (see folder `.phan\config.php`) or use your own; just make a copy of `.phan\config.php` and copy it into your project's folder.

For more information about Phan, please take a look on the [Phan repository](https://github.com/phan/phan).

Note: be sure that Phan is installed by running `composer global require phan/phan` (or by using the composer.json mentioned in chapter 1)

#### 2. PHPStan

PHPStan is a static analysis tool and help to discover bugs in code without running it!

You can use rules defined in this package (see file `phpstan.eon`) or use your own; just make a copy of `phpstan.eon` and copy it into your project's root folder.

For more information about PHPStan, please take a look on the [PHPStan repository](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan).

Note: be sure that PHPStan is installed by running `composer global require phpstan/phpstan` (or by using the composer.json mentioned in chapter 1)

##### Common errors

###### Autoloading not configured properly

If, inside your script, you're using external classes; be sure that your autoloader are loaded by PHPStan. If not, you'll receive the following error:
`Class A_CLASS_NAME was not found while trying to analyse it - autoloading is probably not configured properly.`

The solution: take a copy of the `phpstan.neon` present in this repository and copy the file in your application's root folder. Then edit the file and add your autoloader file; f.i.:

```
parameters:
    - autoload_files:
        - %currentWorkingDirectory%/my_autoloader.php
```

(don't remove any lines, just add yours)

#### 3. PHPCPD

PHP Copy/Paste detector will help to detect duplicate code in PHP files.

Do you've copied five or more lines from that file and paste it there and there? Sometimes, a do this for just a test and ... forget these lines.

For more information about PHPCPD, please take a look on the [PHPCPD repository](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpcpd).

Note: be sure that PHPCPD is installed by running `composer global require sebastian/phpcpd` (or by using the composer.json mentioned in chapter 1)

#### 4. PHPCS

PHPCS tokenizes PHP, JavaScript and CSS files to detect violations of a defined coding standard.

See also [PHPCBF](#9-phpcbf) for automatically fixing somes violations detected by PHPCS.

For more information about PHPCS, please take a look on the [PHPCS repository](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer). Also take a look on the configuration options : [https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki/Configuration-Options](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki/Configuration-Options)

#### 6. PHPMND

PHP Magical Number will analyze your source code and try to find hardcoded figures like in:

```php
if (mb_strlen($password) > 7) {
  throw new InvalidArgumentException("password");
}
```

And suggest to create constants so it'll be much more easier to maintain.

```php
const MAX_PASSWORD_LENGTH = 7;
[...]
if (mb_strlen($password) > self::MAX_PASSWORD_LENGTH)
```
